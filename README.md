# Tic-Tac-Toe AI (Minimax & Alpha-Beta Pruning)

This is a command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Python, featuring an AI opponent using either the **Minimax algorithm** or **Alpha-Beta pruning** for optimal move decisions.

## 🎮 Features

- Play Tic-Tac-Toe against an unbeatable AI.
- Choose between:
  - **Minimax** algorithm
  - **Alpha-Beta Pruning** optimization
- Node evaluation count displayed for each AI move.
- Clean and readable code structure with `Game` and `AI` classes.

## 🧠 Algorithms Used

- **Minimax**: Explores all possible future game states to find the best move.
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Improves Minimax by pruning branches that won't affect the result.
